#### Introduction
*The data in this project is derived from 2007 Gender Information. Our group was drawn to this data given our shared background of discrimination in the workplace and society. After experiencing gender inequality together during a separate project earlier in the year, we wanted to learn more about how large this issue is on a macro level.*

#### Web Scraping
```{r}
#gdp per capita
url <- "https://photius.com/rankings/economy/gdp_per_capita_2007_0.html"
webpage <- read_html(url)
country_gdp <- html_text(html_nodes(webpage, '.desktop~ tr+ tr td:nth-child(3)'))
gdp_per_capita <- as.numeric(gsub("\\$|,", "", html_text(html_nodes(webpage, '.desktop~ tr+ tr td:nth-child(4)'))))
#democracy-dictatorship score
url2 <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy-Dictatorship_Index"
webpage2 <- read_html(url2)
country_DD <- html_text(html_nodes(webpage2, '.datasortkey a'))
DD <- html_text(html_nodes(webpage2, 'td:nth-child(2)'))
DD_type <- gsub("\n", "", html_text(html_nodes(webpage2, 'td:nth-child(3)')))
#percent in parliament
url3 <- "http://archive.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/classif311207.htm"
webpage3 <- read_html(url3)
country_parliament <- gsub(" 1", "", html_text(html_nodes(webpage3, 'tr~ tr+ tr td:nth-child(2)')))
percent_parliament <- as.numeric(gsub("\\%", "", html_text(html_nodes(webpage3, 'tr~ tr+ tr td:nth-child(6)'))))
#male vs. female gross national income per capita (USD PPP)
url4 <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_male_to_female_income_ratio"
webpage4 <- read_html(url4)
country_income <- str_trim(gsub("\\*", "", html_text(html_nodes(webpage4, 'td:nth-child(1)'))))
female_income <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", html_text(html_nodes(webpage4, 'td:nth-child(3)'))))
male_income <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", html_text(html_nodes(webpage4, 'td:nth-child(2)'))))
ratio <- as.numeric(gsub("\n", "", html_text(html_nodes(webpage4, 'td:nth-child(4)'))))
```
*I scraped data on GDP per capita, government type, percent of women in lower/single house parliament, and male vs. female gross national income per capita (USD PPP) for countries in 2007 across various websites with the help of the SelectorGadget Chrome extension. I then cleaned the data as necessary using gsub for commas, trailing spaces, and other characters.*

*The final cleaned and merged dataset used 14 continuous variables and 3 categorical variables. Gender-specific data was collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/gender-info-2007) and additional data was scraped from various websites.*

*The original Kaggle gender information data was first condensed by removing irrelevant columns to be able to upload to GitHub. The condensed datafile is loaded then cut to include only 6 variables that we wanted to analyze. The values of year sometimes had multiple years, so for simplicity, we only kept the first year in each row.  Irrelevant columns were removed, and only complete rows were kept. Next, because some countries had several years worth of data for certain variables, we only kept the most recent data values for duplicate rows. The major cleaning aspect was splitting and merging the dataset. The dataset did not have each variable as a separate column and instead just named all the variables in one column, we had to separate the rows to make analysis much easier. Each variable was split and merged together to form a dataframe in which each variable was given a separate column. Only complete cases were kept in the final data. Finally, the additional web scraped data was pulled from GitHub and merged with the cleaned Kaggle data to form the finalmerge.csv file for analysis. The main issues we encountered was finding that data for most variables only existed for certain countries as well as separating variables into different columns without taking too many lines of code.*

#### Correlation Test 
```{r}
class(gender_info$cont_prev_rate)
(cor1test <- cor.test(gender_info$cont_prev_rate, gender_info$fertility_rate))
plot(gender_info$cont_prev_rate, gender_info$fertility_rate, pch = 19, col = "skyblue", xlab = "Contraceptive Prevalence Rate", ylab = "Total Fertility Rate (per woman)")
mtext("Contraceptive Prevalence Rate vs Total Fertility Rate", cex = 1.2, line = 1)
```
*The p-value of < 2.2e-16 is extremely small (certainly less than 0.05), so we conclude that the correlation is statistically significantly different from zero. The confidence interval for the true correlation is (-0.82, -0.92) which is well away from zero.*

#### T-test & T-test Bootstrap
(Show ability to create bootstrap confidence interval for either a t-test or a correlation. For full marks, should include histogram with both regular and bootstrapped CI shown, as well as a short sentence description of results. Plots should be clearly labeled, well formatted, and display an aesthetic sense.)
```{r}
t.test(gender_info$percent_women_in_parliament, mu = 0.5)
boxplot(gender_info$percent_women_in_parliament, horizontal = T, col = "royalblue", xlab = "Percentage", main = "Percentage of Women in Parliament", lwd = 2)
(parm_ci <- t.test(gender_info$percent_women_in_parliament, mu = 0.5)$conf.int) 
N <- nrow(gender_info)
n_samp <- 10000
WomenParli <- rep(NA, n_samp)
for (i in 1:n_samp){
sample_wparli <- sample(gender_info$percent_women_in_parliament, length(gender_info$percent_women_in_parliamen), replace = TRUE)  
WomenParli[i] <- mean(sample_wparli)
}
(boot_ci <- quantile(WomenParli, c(0.025, 0.975)))
hist(gender_info$percent_women_in_parliament, main = "Percent of Women in Parliament", xlab = "Percent", col = "royalblue", cex.main = 0.8, breaks = 50)
abline(v = boot_ci,col = "palevioletred",lwd = 3)
abline(v = parm_ci, col = "slategray2", lwd = 3, lty = 2)
legend("topleft", c("Parametric CI", "Bootstrapped CI"), lwd = 3, col = c("brown2","purple2"), lty = c(2, 1))
hist(WomenParli, main = "Mean Percent Return Percent of Women in Parliament", xlab = "Percent", col = "royalblue", cex.main = 0.8, breaks = 50)
abline(v = boot_ci,col = "palevioletred",lwd = 3)
abline(v = parm_ci, col = "slategray2", lwd = 3, lty = 2)
legend("topleft", c("Parametric CI", "Bootstrapped CI"), lwd = 3, col = c("slategray2","palevioletred"), lty = c(2, 1))
```
*Given that the p-value is less than 2.2e-16, we can reject the null hypothesis. We reject the null hypothesis that the true mean of womenâ€™s share of tertiary education is equal to 50%.*
*The boot CI is a bit narrower than the parametric CI; however, the difference is quite small.*

#### Permutation Test 
(Include at least one. For full marks, should include histogram with results, line for actual statistic value, p-value of permutation, and short sentence description of results)
```{r}
permCor(gender_info$lfp_rate_m, gender_info$lfp_rate_f)
permCor(gender_info$lfp_rate_m,gender_info$lfp_rate_f, plotit = F)
par.cex = 0.6
permCor(gender_info$male_GNI_per_capita, gender_info$female_GNI_per_capita) 
permCor(gender_info$male_GNI_per_capita, gender_info$female_GNI_per_capita, plotit = F)
```
*The permuted sample correlations for labor force participation rate for males and females has a p-value of 0.0176. This suggests that we reject the null hypothesis. At a significance level of 0.05, we conclude that the labor force participation rate for men and women are different between gender groups.The permuted sample correlations for GNI per capita between men and women has a p-value of 0. We reject the null hypothesis as the observed data is extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. Therefore, the men and women GNI per capita difference is highly based off the difference in gender.* 

#### Multiple Regression
(Few sentence intro to plan for multiple regression, variables used, process, etc. Use either backwards stepwise regression or some form of best subsets regression. Should include residual plots. A GLM with a mix of continuous and categorical predictors is fine here.)
*Insert plan*
(Normal Quantile Plot of residuals, plot of fits vs. residuals, discussion. Plots should be clearly labeled, well formatted, and display an aesthetic sense.)
```{r}

```{r}
#boxplot
par(mar = c(10, 4, 5, 2), cex = .8)
boxplot(w_tert_enroll ~ type_of_government, data = gender_info, col = 'yellow', main = "Women's Share of Tertiary Enrollment by Government Type", ylab = "Women's Share of Tertiary Enrollment", xlab = "", cex.axis = 0.7, las = 2)

plot(TukeyHSD(aov1), las = 1)
#check assumptions
par(cex.main = 0.75, cex.lab = 1, mar = c(4, 5, 5, 2))
myResPlots2(aov1, label = "Women's Share of Tertiary Enrollment by Government Type")
bartlett.test(gender_info$w_tert_enroll, gender_info$type_of_government)
```
*In the boxplot the five-point-summary of fatality varies greatly by government type, indicating a possible difference in means (in particular, civilian and military dictatorships have a much smaller women's share of tertiary enrollment). It is reasonable to assume that the variances are the same across groups because the ratio of largest to smallest sample standard deviations is 1.7, which is less than 2. The mean share of tertiary enrollment is statistically significantly different between government types because the p-value of 0.000147 is less than alpha at 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean women's share of tertiary education by government type. Except for in comparison to Royal Dictatorships, any pair of government type with Military Dictatorships had a statistically significant difference in mean women's share of tertiary enrollment, as the p-values were all less than alpha at 0.05. Finally, the residuals appear to be normally distributed as most fall within the 95% confidence interval of the normal quantile plot. Furthermore, the residuals all fall within the 95% confidence interval in the fits vs. residuals plot, and our tests of equal variance do not show a statistically significant difference in standard deviations across groups, as the p-values are greater than alpha at 0.05. Therefore, we meet ANOVA's assumptions that residuals are normally distributed within each group and that variability within groups is relatively constant across groups.*
